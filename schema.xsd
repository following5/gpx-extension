            This schema describes Opencaching Network extensions to the:

            1. Topografix GPX file XML schema, identified by "http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0"
               XML namespace. We will refer to elements in this namespace using the "gpx:"
               prefix.

            2. Groundspeak's geocaching GPX extensions, identified by
               "http://www.groundspeak.com/cache/1/0/1" XML namespace. We will refer to
               elements in this namespace using the "groundspeak:" prefix.

            Note, that "Opencaching Network" refers to the sites such as Opencaching.PL and
            Opencaching.DE, NOT the (discontinued) Garmin's OpenCaching.COM site.

            Some Opencaching-specific information is missing in this schema. It may be
            added later in a backward-compatible manner. E.g.

            - Opencaching geocache attributes
            - Opencaching log entry types
            - Opencaching waypoint types
            - Opencaching cache maintenance state flags

                            The type of geocache in terms of common Opencaching types.
                            So far, the following types have been defined:

                            * Traditional Cache
                            * Multi-cache
                            * Quiz Cache
                            * Moving Cache
                            * Virtual Cache
                            * Webcam Cache
                            * Podcast Cache
                            * Event Cache
                            * Own Cache
                            * Other Cache

                            The types "Quiz", "Moving", "Podcast", "Own" and "Other" are
                            not defined for groundspeak:type and will usually be mapped to
                            groundspeak:type "Unknown Cache", which usually will be
                            understood as "Mystery Cache" or "Quiz Cache".

                            Note that the type "Other Cache" is called "Unknown Cache"
                            or "Unknown type" on the OC websites. We adopted the
                            OKAPI naming "Other" here, which clearer expresses its
                            meaning and distinguishes it from Groundspeak "Unknown Cache".

                            More OC types may be added. You should be prepared to handle
                            them, so that your app does not break if it encounters an
                            unknown cache type.

                            The size of the geocache. So far, the following sizes
                            have been definied:

                            The "waypoint code" of a listing of this geocache at another
                            geocaching site. E.g. the codes  OP8EB7 (Opencaching.PL),
                            OC12C6F (Opencaching.DE) and GC6BX4Z (Geocaching.COM) represent
                            different listings of the same geocache. If gpx:wpt contains
                            the Opencaching.PL listing, then gpx:name is OP8EB7, while there
                            can be oc:other_code elements for OC12C6F and GC6BX4Z.

                            Please keep in mind that all the properties of a geocache can
                            be different in different listings. E.g when this schema was
                            drafted, OP8EB7 had difficulty 2, OC12C6F had difficulty 2.5 and
                            GC6BX4Z had difficulty 1.5. The geocache properties given in
                            a GPX file only refer to the gpx:name listings, not to the
                            oc:other_code listings.

                            Any uppercase string may appear as waypoint code.

                It is NOT guaranteed that there is a matching groundspeak:log element!

                    The site-dependent ID of the log entry. If there is a groundspeak:log
                    element with the same ID, then it contains information of the same
                    log entry.

                    IMPORTANT NOTE: This ID is unique only for GPX files from the same
                    source. Different log entries retrieved from different geocaching
                    websites can have the same ID. Also, when Opencaching websites will
                    eventually be interconnected, the same log entry will have different
                    IDs when retrieved from different Opencaching sites. So if you need
                    a unique and safe identifier for log entries, use the UUID instead.

                <xs:documentation>
                    This element contains the UUID of the log entry. You can use it
                    to retrieve additional information about the log entry through
                    the Opencaching API (OKAPI), or just as a globally unique
                    identifier of the log entry.

                    Note: Though this attribute is optional by definition, all OC
                    websites which support the OC GPX extension supply it for each
                    log entry. So when retrieving data from an OC site, you can rely
                    on the UUID. Also, if you process the oc:logs element, you MUST
                    NOT discard UUIDs, but retain them in any GPX output.

                    The only case when the UUID may be omitted is if you create a
                    GPX file from some source with does not supply an OC UUID, but
                    need to include other oc:log properties like the site team entry
                    flag.
